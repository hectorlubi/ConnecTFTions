# ConnecTFTions

A fan-made **NYT Connections–style** puzzle game themed around **Teamfight Tactics (TFT)**!
Group units by their **shared traits, origins, or costs** before running out of mistakes.

**Play it here:** [https://your-username.github.io/ConnecTFTions/](https://your-username.github.io/ConnecTFTions/)

## Gameplay

* You’re given 16 tiles, each labeled with a TFT unit’s name.
* Your goal is to group them into **4 sets of 4** based on shared traits.
* Each incorrect guess uses up a **guess**. You have **4 mistakes** available.
* You can **shuffle**, **deselect**, or **submit** your guesses.
* Once a group is solved, it locks it in revealing its group.
